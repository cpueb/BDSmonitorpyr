# Introduction of BDSmomitorpyr
---
You need to prepare LiteLoaderBDS and BDSpyrunner before you use BDSmonitorpyr.I will explain how to download them first.Here I thank Shrbox and other developers.  

[LiteLoaderBDS](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderBDS)  

[BDSpyrunner](https://github.com/twoone-3/BDSpyrunner)  

[Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7)  

The first version v1.0 may be released on January 20. Please wait!BDSmonitorpyr is a Python based extension library - Tkinter, which is a visual extension. At the same time, the api comes from what the plug-in supports.We developed it because we found that there is no visual management interface outside Minecraft, and the server and client are compatible at the same time. At the same time, we did not tell the client of this plug-in that the Flask library is used, which is convenient for us developers and makes secondary development possible. We are a public welfare organization, and we hope to be sponsored and recognized by everyone. Thank you
